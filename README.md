Welcome to Matt Nevers' Terraform project!

In this project I demonstrate understanding and usage of several different
terraform concepts. I utilize different resource types, modules, outputs,
variables, dynamic blocks, provisioning, tags, workspaces etc to create a test home lab
enviornement with pseduo DEV and PRD labelling.

Creds are securely stored in AWS CLI, and terraform.tfvars is ommited from
github with .gitignore so to hide sensitve personal info from public.
